Questions:Approximately 2~4 minutes per question 

(1) Could we have your name and the reason why you are interested 
in Rakuten? 
Hello my name is A.C and I am interested in Rakuten because living in Japan and working as a Software developer is 
difficult not to hear about Rakuten reputation.If you like web development I think is one of the best places to go, on top
of that Rakuten is using mostly open source technologies and I really like that.


Last time I answered:
1. Please tell us the motive for the application.
First of all, I respect Rakuten as a company because they were able to accomplish so much in such a short time span. 
Specifically to the position, Rakuten Ichiba is probably the most important division in the company. 
I would love to work on and learn more about this successful e-commerce platform. 
On top of this, I think I am a good match for this position not only because of my experience but most important 
my adaptability and interest in technology.

(2) Please tell us your technical background and how you will be able to contribute to the success of the company.
Å@Å@If you already have work experience, please share that as well.

I don't know if this is relevant but I was always interested in technology and computers as a matter of fact my first 
programming experience was when I was 10 years old. I attend a course on Basic after school hours. Unfortunately computers 
were expensive at that time and I could not afford one. Speaking about working experience I was able to work on different
roles or perspectives since/such as computer seller, computer department maintenance, helpdesk, programmer, analyst/programmer, 
project lead. I worked on different types of projects since small applications to big enterprise applications and I worked 
alone and as a part of a big team etc.. I think I can contribute to Rakuten because of my experience and my passion about 
computers, technology and science.

(3) What is your greatest strength and how you leverage your strength for peak performance? Please give us an example.
I think one of my best attributes could be my adaptability,in life for example I have been living in 3 different countries 
with a lot of daily challenges because of the culture and languages. Related to work I am always a person who enjoys learning 
new things and accept new challenges. For example in my current job a new project arise and the client required an application
 in PHP, and even though I never use PHP in the past, I took the challenge to be the only one developing the most difficult 
 parts of the project in that language without any help.  


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)*This question is for only those who have worked before* Have you ever changed your job? or are you trying to change 
your job? Please tell us why.
Yes, When I changed jobs in the past was mainly because I wanted to accept new projects or roles that I was interested in so 
I could get the chance of exploring new approaches or perspectives of software development field and of course in most of 
the cases I improved my working conditions while I was doing that as well.



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) What are your career goal and career plans? How does this job fit into your career plans?
My career goal is to have a job that I can enjoy, to work for a company that has good reputation and with the resources 
of being able to explore new projects with the best technologies and best software practices, somewhere where I can learn 
a lot and at the same time be able to contribute to the company success. I think based on this, that Rakuten could be the 
company where I could stay for the rest of my career.
